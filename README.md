## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned
Switching to a responsive website can be easy and be done with eithe Mobile -first workflow or Desktop-first workflow. I prefer Mobile-first.
Also, I learned there are several ways to do this without CSS grid  or flexbox. will be using flexbox after this.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div id="top-section">
        <h2>Join our community</h2>

        <h4>30-day, hassle-free money back guarantee</h4>

        <p>
          Gain access to our full library of tutorials along with expert code
          reviews. Perfect for any developers who are serious about honing their
          skills.
        </p>
      </div>

```
```css
body {
  padding: 20px;
}
h2, h4, p {
  margin: 0;
}
```



### Continued development

Making card without flexbox comes with whitespace issues which can be annoying to deal with because it is unexpected. So im looking forward to building with flexbox and grid
